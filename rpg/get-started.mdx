# `Get Started`

  Welcome to the world of Jolyne! Here on this page, you’ll find a guide to the
  basics of the game, to help you to get started.

## Start your adventure
<hr />
  First of all, make sure you’ve
  started your bizarre adventure by using the <span className="font-bold text-jolyne">/adventure start</span> command. After
  starting your adventure, you get some items to help you along the way (3
  pizzas, 500 coins and a mysterious arrow).

## Awake your stand
<hr />
  To awake your stand, you need to use the <span className="font-bold text-jolyne">/items use</span> command and use the mysterious arrow that you've been given.<br/> After
  awakening your stand, you get a random stand. You can use the <span className="font-bold text-jolyne">/stand view</span> command to
  view your stand.

  See <a style={{ color: 'rgb(59,130,246)' }} href="/docs/rpg/stands">here</a> for more information about stands.
  
## Bite the dust
<hr />
Once you start the game remember you could reset once so if you think you didn't get anything on the first adventure you can reset,
to reset you would type (<span className="font-bold text-jolyne">/Reset Adventure</span>) to restart your adventure.
